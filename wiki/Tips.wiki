#summary Shows how to change the latency of the FTDI drivers in OSX

= Introduction =

To talk to the dynamixel we use the [http://support.robotis.com/en/product/auxdevice/interface/usb2dxl_manual.htm USB2Dynamixel]. This adapter uses the [http://www.ftdichip.com/Products/ICs/FT232R.htm FT232R] chip.
The FTDI drivers on OSX have a default latency of 16ms. To change this behavior you have to change the driver like described in this [https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.ftdichip.com/Documents/TechnicalNotes/TN_105%2520Adding%2520Support%2520for%2520New%2520FTDI%2520Devices%2520to%2520Mac%2520Driver.pdf&sa=U&ei=3y1UUO6KIMKk0AWm7IHYAg&ved=0CAYQFjAA&client=internal-uds-cse&usg=AFQjCNGiKAA-8cGM0jMNkrHasvnIyifDqw document].




= Step by Step =

  * Copy the FTDI driver to a local folder, you can find the driver at
{{{
/System/Library/Extensions/FTDIUSBSerialDriver.kext
}}}
  * Download this [http://simple-dynamixel.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ext/Info.plist.zip file] and unzip it
  * Copy the file into the FTDI Driver. Go to the finder and show the package content(right mouse click)
  * copy the file to
{{{
/Contents
}}}
  * Open the terminal and type:
{{{
$ touch /yourPath/FTDIUSBSerialDriver.kext
}}}
  * Copy the driver to this folder
{{{
$ sudo cp -r /yourPath/FTDIUSBSerialDriver.kext /System/Library/Extensions/
